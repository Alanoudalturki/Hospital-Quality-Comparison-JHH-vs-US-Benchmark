# Hospital-Quality-Comparison-JHH-vs-US-Benchmark
Comparative analysis of hospital performance and quality metrics between Johns Hopkins Hospital and top-ranked U.S. hospitals. This project evaluates patient satisfaction, readmission, mortality rates, and other key indicators using structured health services data.

# Comparative Analysis of Hospital Quality Metrics  
### Johns Hopkins Hospital vs. Top U.S. Hospitals

---

## Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of hospital performance metrics between Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) and leading U.S. hospitals ranked by patient experience and clinical outcomes. The objective is to evaluate healthcare quality indicators, identify performance patterns, and highlight strengths or potential areas of improvement in care delivery.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze publicly available hospital data
- Compare key performance metrics across hospitals
- Visualize differences in patient satisfaction, readmission, and mortality rates
- Generate insights to support hospital quality improvement and benchmarking

---

## Contents

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks analyzing:

- Patient Communication Satisfaction (Doctor, Nurse)
- Discharge Information & Responsiveness
- Overall Hospital Rating
- Readmission Rates ( Heart Failure, Pneumonia)
- Mortality Rates (Heart Failure, Pneumonia, AMI)
- Staff Responsiveness & Satisfaction

Each notebook provides visualizations and statistical comparisons between JHH and its peer institutions.
